                    With the digital boom, many players are now offering
                    digital marketing services. The latter can be agencies,
                    firms, start-ups, freelance consultants. It is therefore

                    First, define your goals clearly and precisely. Know that
                    an agency should not work for you, but with you. It is
                    necessary to dwell on the achievements of the agency. The
                    latter’s portfolio can help you with this. The more an
                    agency is made up of experts who can intervene in all
                    areas of web marketing, the more it will be able to meet
                    all your requirements.

                    On the price side, each agency has a different billing
                    grid. Compare quotes in proportion to your expectations
                    and your budget. Beware of pre-encrypted offers and
                    promises of quick results. Instead, favour tailor-made
                    work and favour agencies that offer engagement periods.
